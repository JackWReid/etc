# downscale/__init__.py

# This file marks the 'downscale' directory as a Python package.
# It can be left empty or used to expose package-level variables/functions.
# For this project, it can remain empty as modules are imported directly
# using relative imports (e.g., `from . import config`).

# Optionally, you could define package-level metadata here:
# __version__ = "0.1.0"
