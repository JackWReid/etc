	<p>Canvas Theatre approached me for their brand design as a brand new venture. Hoping to produce innovative, digitally enhanced theatre and hoping to attract a young and wildly creative set of collaborating artists, Rosie and Ciaran from Canvas told me that they like clean lines, simple textures, and muted colours.</p>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>The guys told me that they would be working with digital technology to create a new kind of set design that would blur the lines between art, film, and theatre, so the name they had chosen for their company seemed refreshingly apt. Beginning with the logo, my initial, rough directions mostly focused on this canvas physical metaphor. There is of course of challenge of how you depict something that is conspicuously blank, whilst still making a striking logo. A couple of the ideas you see above play with the idea of whitespace to evoke that blank canvas, without being totally… blank.</p>

<figure class="work-section--simple-center-image">
	<img class="work-section--simple-center-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/oxygen.png" alt="Oxygen Direction">
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>We tried out a few developments of an idea I labelled Oxygen. The main strike of the logo was that it was composed mostly of a logotype and its placement on a rectangular gradient. This meant that the logo could be placed over any black and white image that fit the profile and remain an interpretation of the logo. However, whilst this is an interesting concept, it proves too difficult to implement amongst busy designs where each element is vying for attention.</p>

<figure class="work-section--simple-center-image">
	<img class="work-section--simple-center-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/wedge.png" alt="Wedge Direction">
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>Next, I developed a direction called Wedge. This direction evoked the form of the canvas by focusing on the corner, in particular the shape it makes when you shove those little wedges in the back of the corner of the canvas to make it more taut. As you can see, I’m not really one for the technical language of art supplies. We tried out the logo idea in the context of some stock photography, and I saw that the ticks, as we called them, could be used as a supplemental icon without the text. However, the guys from Canvas found the logo too heavy, and a little oppressive.</p>
</section>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>We had an idea to keep the suggestion of the corner of a canvas, whilst making the logo less heavy. Flipping the corner round to the diagonal and breaking the text over that V shape. It softens the entire form, and allows us to move away from the broad canvas frame slightly. This development is the final idea that we went with. Below is an excerpt from the brand style guide we developed, with some type treatments to boot.</p>

</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>Not long after we'd completed the brand project, Canvas got in touch again and said that they'd like to start work on a website. The site would have to advertise upcoming shows, showcase previous work, provide information about artists and collaborators, and show off the projects such a workshops and scratch nights. Building quickly up from the style we'd established during the brand design process, we were able to speak more structurally about the presentation and hierarchy of information.</p>

	<img class="work-section--simple-center-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/webconcept1.png" alt="First web concept">
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>Above is an early idea that really emphasizes whitespace, with a relatively small body font size and an atypical alignment of content to the right hand side of a containing column. The left hand side of the page was to be the anchoring navigational element that would allow for increasingly eccentric layouts on the right hand side. In the back of my mind, I was already considering how easy it would be to implement transition animations between content areas with AJAX in the right portion of the design.</p>

<figure class="work-section--simple-center-image final-panel">
	<img class="work-section--simple-center-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/webconcept2.png" alt="Second web concept">
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>Right away, the folks at Canvas emphasised their desire for images to take centre stage on their website. Here is a very roughly hewn impression of a very airy masonry layout, where every item on the homepage would have a dominant image, and the size of that image on the homepage would establish visual information hierarchy. An invert or ghosting of the header ends the page on a symmetrical note.</p>

<figure class="work-section--simple-center-image final-panel">
	<img class="work-section--simple-center-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/webconcept3.png" alt="Third web concept">
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>Taking some queues from websites in adjacent genres like museums and galleries, I came up with this concept. Again, the flow of content is not immediately obvious, and instead emphasizes expressive layout and whitespace, perhaps over explicit and obvious user flow. I really like the overlapping in the top element in this design, but even as I put this mock together I had in my mind a million CSS layout problems, particularly with responsiveness in mind.</p>

<figure class="work-section--simple-center-image final-panel">
	<img class="work-section--simple-center-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/webconcept4.png" alt="Final web concept">
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>This is the direction that we ultimately followed. It has a somewhat more conventional page flow, but I think it is the most elegant execution of the Canvas palette and style guide thus far. Also, the image take centre stage like the Canvas team asked for. Almost all of the elements in this mock evolved a lot by the time their descendants reached production, but the cues are all there in this mock.</p>

<figure class="work-section--screened-image">
	<div class="work-section--screened-image__container">
		<img class="work-section--screened-image__topper" src="{{ site.url }}/images/browsertop.png"/>
		<div class="work-section--screened-image__container__area">
			<img class="work-section--screened-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/webfinal-intro.png" alt="Canvas Home Intro">
		</div>
	</div>
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>The team wanted a really compelling landing page, so I went for a bold white on black design with a full bleed background image. The effect is striking, but not all consuming. The landing screen is only 100vh tall. The user can follow one of two immediate instincts once they've taken in this screen: scroll to the whole homepage below, or immediately start diving into the site with the obvious navigation presented.</p>
</section>

<figure class="work-section--screened-image">
	<div class="work-section--screened-image__container">
		<img class="work-section--screened-image__topper" src="{{ site.url }}/images/browsertop.png"/>
		<div class="work-section--screened-image__container__area">
			<img class="work-section--screened-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/webfinal-tiles.png" alt="Canvas Home Tiles">

	</div>
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>Here are those all-encompassing image elements in production. These elements cry out for great photography and imagery, which luckily this bunch of Cornwall creatives seem to crank out at high volume. What could have been a dull menu of contents becomes a gallery of beautiful images all its own.</p>
</section>

<figure class="work-section--screened-image">
	<div class="work-section--screened-image__container">
		<img class="work-section--screened-image__topper" src="{{ site.url }}/images/browsertop.png"/>
		<div class="work-section--screened-image__container__area">
			<img class="work-section--screened-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}/images/art/canvas/webfinal-news.png" alt="Canvas Home News">
		</div>
	</div>
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>The layout is ultimately modular. While there is some information hierarchy provided by panel colouring and titles, it's very easy for the flow of the homepage to change drastically based on what's most important to the theatre company at the time. At the time of all these screenshots, the company is promoting an upcoming show, so all those tiles above relate to aspects of that show, and they come in before the news panel - which has been pushed down. Underneath that is another panel element referencing something of a lower priority at the time: youth workshops.</p>

			<img class="work-section--screened-image__image" src="{{ site.url }}images/art/canvas/webfinal-team.png" alt="Canvas Team">
		</div>
	</div>
</figure>

<section class="work-section--text-section">
	<p>The structure of pages past the homepage are relatively uniform, again emphasising imagery above all else. Thanks to CSS filters (praise be), images in the headers of pages and posts are uniformly black and white and subdued.</p>
