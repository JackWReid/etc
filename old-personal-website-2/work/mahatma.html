			<p class="work-section--right-third__text">Mahatma had already established a solid foundation of brand identity, with a distinctive word mark and a deep, warm shade of red. I fleshed this palette out, keeping the warm tones present and introducing some more neutral shades for use around larger pieces of text. The result is a palette that is simultaneously bohemian-feeling and slick.</p>

		<p>The guys from Mahatma weren’t sure at first what purposes they wanted their website to serve. After some conversations we figured out that their main focus was giving a richer, more branded experience that what could be offered through their Facebook page and events (their primary publicity method). Pursuant to that goal, the website lands the user straight onto a stream of cards that present the nights the group have put on, or are about to put on. There is little to nothing distracting the user from the key function, the events. The website’s navigation bar isn’t at the top of the page, below the header, nor is it fixed anywhere on the viewport. This bold decision was made for a few reasons. For one, I settled on a chunky feel from the outset, where all buttons and links were almost oversized and clearly visible, and given some physicality with some subtle shadows. This meant that if I had placed the navigation at the top of the page, the content would have pushed unacceptably far down the viewport. Second, we realised early on that this website wouldn’t be a content-heavy one. Each event card is very simple and brief, and gallery page would never stretch too far down. So, I reasoned that a simple flick of the scroll would always land the user at the navigation bar at the bottom of the page. Coupled with the fierce simplicity of the website, this meant that a navigation at the bottom of the content did little to harm UX, whilst really allowing the content itself to take the limelight. Here you see the website in its dormant setup, with direct calls to action, instead of non-contenty content.</p>

	<p>The Mahatma website fulfils a few key functions. It represents their brand identity more than a single poster or Facebook page ever could. It gives the group a hub for their galleries, contact information, and event information. Given that I was able to strip down what the guys really wanted from their website, I could allow the visuals to take the foreground, with a bohemian, humanistic aesthetic that doesn’t get cluttered up.</p>
