	<p>Moe Logic is a Bath, Somerset based nightlife company that began putting on parties in 2012. At the outset, they contacted me to create for them a striking logo and brand to set them apart from the myriad other bass music nights vying for attention in the area. Landing on this striking tie dye-based logo and type motif, we were all pretty happy with the outcome.</p>

	<p>The Moe Logic roundel started popping up around the city in the form of stickers handed out on the nights and by street teams. Meanwhile, every new night demanded a new event poster that too, was posted up around town and online. These were created by mixing brand fundamentals we established at the outset, and event-by-event modifications. What we ended up with is a wealth of cohesive but varied poster designs.</p>
