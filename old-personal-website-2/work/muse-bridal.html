	<p>After taking over a prime retail space in my home town, Muse Bridal got in touch with me to help them get themselves a website. Being a five minute down my own High Street, they invited me in for a chat in the boutique itself to talk about the goals of the project and to kick off the design process.</p>

	<p>Muse Bridal already had a set of logos and styles that I solidified into a cohesive brand guide. After working this out with the client, we started the process of hashing out the main functions of the site, and the stylistic preferences to be integrated. We landed on a contemporary bridal theme, to gel with other brand elements. A traditional looking duck egg blue is offset by shots of a dark silver throughout the site, which are finally softened with an off-white.</p>

	<p>Reservations around gender stereotypes notwithstanding, the client advocated for a luxurious and feminine style. A traditonal cursive marks the title panels, images of the bridal fitting suite are full width and sumptuous. Below, spacious panes in alternating paper tones show off the designers the bridal boutique carries.</p>

	<p>Muse Bridal was a very different job for me. Rather than working in longer, asyncronous email conversations with the client - I worked in design sprints that I brought into the bridal shop for critique and feedback. Different too was the market of the client's business. The people at Muse Bridal really know their extremely specific and niche demographic better than anybody - so I took a lot of cues from them about what brides are going to be making these big decisions based upon.</p>
