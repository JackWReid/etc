	<p>While I was at the university of Exeter, me and a few friends founded the university's official music magazine. This new magazine needed a visual brand for all of its properties. That meant a logo and a style, a website that would be the online magazine itself, and all the graphic design around publicity and marketing (and there would have to be a lot of publicity and marketing).</p>

	<p>The first iteration of the homepage had a very prominent blurb about what the magazine is, right near the top of the page. That blurb is still there, but now it's right at the bottom. Instead, I realised I wanted to show rather than tell what the magazine does. So up top is a slider, which is the only part of the homepage the editors have to curate. Then underneath are the latest posts from various sections of the website. The aim here is to surface as much content for the user as possible, to make the homepage come to life - like a shopfront.</p>

	<p>Album artwork is the best. I don't know what music apps and platforms would do with their UI design if it weren't for the existence of album artwork, which, when you think about it, isn't that obvious a thing to exist. I decided to let the album artwork take centre stage on the album reviews page. Most album covers have pretty good recognition rates among engaged readers. But, just in case a reader doesn't know what they're looking at, they can hover and there's an album name and writer's name right there.</p>

	<p>As with any project like this, you have to stick to the content first principle doggedly. With that in mind, I aggressively stripped down the article reading experience. The website header is collapsed right down to just the navigation bar, the article meta data is condensed into a space well shorter than a laptop viewpoint so that you can peak the start of the actual article body right away. Media players and related posts are all pushed to the bottom of the article. All you can see for the most part is the text of the actual article. Whatsmore, its simplicity allows it to look great on mobile too.</p>
