	<p>The owners of Pump Cottage already had an agency work up a logo for them - a nice and simple logotype with a pump handle motif. Around that logo I started to build a brand, starting with a clear palette. Choosing tones that feel warm and hospitable without looking too brown and stale is tricky, but I think we ended up with the perfect palette.</p>

	<p>Right from the start, I helped the owners decide what they wanted from the website, what functions it actually needed to serve. As is usually the case, whether the client realises it or not, the primary goal was conversions. The user is at all times presented with a ‘Book Now’ button in the site header. Because of that, when the user decides they’re after a room at the B&amp;B, they’re never far from the ‘Book’ button. The holy grail content-first principle applies for bed and breakfast website too. In this case, the case to which we must cut is photographs of the B&amp;B’s rooms. The rooms are fantastic, and it wasn’t too hard for me to take some compelling shots for the website. The photographs are presented right from the top as faded backgrounds on each of the accommodation cards. On hover, the images fade into full clarity and the text fades away. This animation was originally a lot more flashy, combination a saturation and scale effect. However, I couldn’t get the animation to degrade satisfactorily on older browsers.</p>

	<p>Finding the bed and breakfast is of course pretty crucial to a good customer experience. A lot of thought went in to how to present location information in a way that nobody could left confused by. The solution was a similar one to that used in the booking panel: multiple paths. In the booking panel, the user could call or email or book online - whichever they are more comfortable with. In the location page, the user can engage with an interactive, embedded Google map. If not, and many of the sites users will be older, they can use the map as a graphical cue for locational information and read the detailed directions below - or simple take down the address.</p>
