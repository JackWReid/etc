	<p>The owner of PureBody Health asked for their website to be refreshed. Aside from aesthetic concerns, they were worried that key information their clients needed to find either wasn't on the website, or was too hard to find. After discussing the key information that needed to be immediately obvious to clients, and what design ideas the owner values - we started exchanging mocks. After landing on a design, the development began.</p>

	<p>The client asked for extremely clean and minimal design, so I focused on paring down the gym's brand to as few elements as possible. Developing an extremely simplified subset of the fairly disparate brand elements the gym had collected up to this point, we landed on this grid logo and primary green. We also agreed that given how simple the site's structure could be, nothing a visitor would be likely to need should be more than a click away from the landing page. So there's a site navigation along the top and four calls to action along the left hand side. Two green cards do double duty as a summary of the gym's primary service areas and large links to find out more.</p>

	<p>In keeping with that idea of site structure simplicity, each page of the website is only "one layer deep". No section has any click-through sub-sections. Above is an example of a site section, Wellbeing. Across the top is the same title and navigation element that all pages except the homepage share. It evokes a mobile OS's modal style as an affordance to the user that the page is a simple layer over the top of the landing page, and return to the root is a simple as clicking the back arrow. That idea is reinforced with animations on page load in and page load out.</p>
