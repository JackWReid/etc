<div class="work-section--finial">
	<p>So I entered the 2015 Meteor Hackathon, and came up with a really fun idea for a plausible Meteor app that I could probably build within the allotted weekend. I put together some designs based around a very religiously followed colour scheme, something I thought might be a constraint. Then, I quickly realised that I would be away for the weekend of the Hackathon and so wouldn’t be able to make the project (at least not for the Hackathon). Not to let fun designs be wasted, I thought I’d show them here.</p>

		<p>The login/onboarding screen is sort of absurdly simple. Using the Twitter API means that you populate the user’s data with the basics (all we’ll ever need, pretty much) in just a couple of clicks.</p>

		<p>Here we see the landing page once the user is logged in: the Games screen. It’s just broken down into cards, each of which is separated by type. At the top is the modal challenge card, which will appear if you click the big orange(?) call-to-action on the left hand side. Below that are listed the currently active games in all the possible states. The first card shows waiting for both players’ responses, then the signed in player’s response, then the opponents response, then the victory state. At the very bottom are the pending challenges and past games.</p>

		<p>Scoreboards are good fun. They encourage people to dive back into the game with that competitive urge, especially when it’s a scoreboard of your friends, even more so when there’s a big, fat Challenge button next to all those smug people above you in the scoreboard. I like bring out peoples’ petty side, what can I say.</p>
