# slashthread
Get information. A collection of Twitter threads.

## why though
I'm using this as a way to collect cool threads on Twitter that I would otherwise lose track of. Right now it's just backed by a `json` file on S3 that I edit.

The repo for that API to hit and page through that `json` file is [here](https://github.com/JackWReid/slashthread-api).
